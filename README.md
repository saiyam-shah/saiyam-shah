## Who Am I?

Hey there! Just a former mining engineer turned data-nerd here. Got a Master's in Business Analytics (fancy way of saying I like numbers). When I'm not decoding data or predicting the future with algorithms, I chill in the game dev world, crafting digital awesomeness.

I make data less boring and a lot more relatable. Ready to make data an adventure rather than a chore? Let's go!

## What I've Built

[YouTube Shorts Generator](https://github.com/nikhilnair31/YouTube-Shorts-Generator)
Designed a platform to create captivating YouTube Shorts by extracting posts from Reddit using the PRAW API, crafting titles and descriptions with GPT‚Äê4, and generating thumbnails and visuals with Stability AI‚Äôs Stable Diffusion model.

[Instagram Like Predictor](https://github.com/nikhilnair31/Insta-Like-Predictor)
Created a tool to estimate likes on Instagram posts, utilizing data fetched via Instaloader and analyzed with the XGBoost model, offering users a glimpse into the potential impact of their content

[Corporate Conundrum: Hunt for the Secret Shaft](https://silhouettte.itch.io/corporate-conundrum-hunt-for-the-secret-shaft)
Corporate Conundrum is a puzzle game powered by GPT that challenges players to use their social engineering skills to uncover the location of a secret shaft hidden within a corporate building.

[MIA - Marvelously Incompetent Assistant](https://github.com/nikhilnair31/MIA)
An AI-powered robot that can help you with your day-to-day tasks. With its powerful natural language processing capabilities, MIA can understand your commands and provide you with personalized assistance. Uses OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-4 API to transcribe and respond to conversations.

[brainFart](https://brainfart.web.app/)
It's a platform for sharing ideas for games/apps/startups. Allows users to upvote/downvote ideas by their utility. Also used an AWS Lambda function that hooks into OpenAI's GPT-4 API on a schedule, to generate ideas based on data scraped from Reddit.

[DeSo](https://github.com/nikhilnair31/DeSo) _**(defunct site)**_
It's a decentralized social platform where users can post their thoughts and images and mint them into NFTs. Built using Gun JS for the decentralized database/authetication and Solidity for the NFT minting smart contracts. The smart contract was then deployed temporarily on the Rinkeby tesnet and eventually on the Polygon Mainnet.

[iselontweetingaboutcryptoagain](https://iselontweetingaboutcryptoagain.web.app/)
A website that overlays historical cryptocurrency prices with Elon Musk's tweets in realtime, for users to infer the degree of his influence on the market. Also used an AWS Lambda function to extract his tweets on an hourly schedule using Twitter's API.

[tasks.ai](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appnamenull.mlscheduler)
This a tasks and reminders app that uses a user's phone usage data to forecast the best time to remind them.
